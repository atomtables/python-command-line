# python-command-line
an attempt to make a cool command line out of python

# this project is difficult
1. in general, python does not have good support for self-made modules, and makes it hard to publicise them in the code
2. python is a high level language and was not really designed for this
3. to make this functional there needs to be a lot of work done in the code

also i feel like stressing myself out over every single detail

ps. going to change to nodejs because of a lack of being able to modify the elements i need to in the code. may revisit this in the future tho
